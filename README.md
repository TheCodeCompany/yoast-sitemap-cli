# Yoast Sitemap CLI

Yoast Sitemap CLI is a WordPress plugin which provides a WP CLI command to build
and cache the root sitemap generated by Yoast. This helps avoid the performance
impacts caused to large sites when Yoast attempts to build the sitemap dynamically
when it is requested.

This plugin adds the following WP CLI command to generate and cache the root
sitemap:

	wp yoast-sitemap-build-root

This will generate the root sitemap and store it as a vanilla XML file in the
uploads directory. This will be automatically served when you hit the root 
sitemap index defined by Yoast. I.e. https://yoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml.

## Set Up

This command should be configured to run via a cron every 10 mins or so, like so:

	*/10 * * * * cd /srv/www/mysite/current && wp yoast-sitemap-build-root --url="https://yoursite.com" 2>&1 2>/dev/null
